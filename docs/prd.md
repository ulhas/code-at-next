# PRD: Landing Page  
### Workshop: "Build & Sell Software" at Next School

---

## 1. Purpose of the Landing Page

- Get students (primary audience) excited to join the workshop.
- Reassure parents (secondary audience) that:
  - this is safe,
  - this is valuable (skills, confidence, creativity, entrepreneurship),
  - this is not just “coding class”; it’s “build something real and try to sell it.”
- Collect sign-ups / interest (lead capture) so we can finalize batch size and logistics.

**Primary CTA:**  
“I want to build my own app” → Join the workshop / Register interest

**Secondary CTA:**  
“Tell me more” → Parent info section / FAQ

---

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary: Students of Next School (Grade 5 and above)
- Likely 9–14 years old.
- Curious, already using apps/games.
- They like the idea of making their own thing.
- They like the idea of money / “my own startup.”
- They respond to achievement and autonomy: “I built this myself,” “My app is live,” “People are using what I made.”

### Secondary: Parents of those students
- Care about:
  - Skill-building for the future (tech literacy).
  - Entrepreneurial thinking and confidence.
  - Safe, guided environment.
  - Time commitment and screen time.
  - Who is teaching and their credibility.

**Tone rule:**  
- The HERO of the page = the kid.  
- But we include “for parents” blocks that feel calm, responsible, credible.

---

## 3. Core Value Proposition (Headline + Sub-head)

### For kids (main hero text)
**Headline:**  
**Build Your Own App. Launch It. Maybe Even Make Money 💸**

**Sub-head:**  
A hands-on workshop at Next School where you create real software (not homework), ship it, and learn how to sell it like a mini startup founder.

### For parents (supporting line nearby)
This is a guided, project-based program in software building, problem solving, and entrepreneurship for Grade 5+ students — taught by a working founder.

---

## 4. Page Sections / Content Requirements

### 4.1 Hero Section (above the fold)

**Elements:**
- Big headline (kid-facing).
- Sub-head (kid-facing).
- Short trust line for parents:
  - “Run in partnership with Next School / Led by Ulhas Mandrawadkar, founder of Procedure Technologies, 8+ years building real products with real clients.”
- Primary CTA button:  
  “I Want In”
- Secondary CTA link (smaller text under it):  
  “Info for Parents →”

**Visual direction:**
- Bright, playful, modern tech aesthetic.
- Kids building on laptops / whiteboards / sticky notes.
- Avoid “corporate startup pitch deck” look. This should feel like a creative lab.

---

### 4.2 "What You’ll Do in This Workshop"

**Talk directly to the student.**

You will:
- Pick a real-world problem you care about.
- Design an app or tool that solves it.
- Build it step by step (we’ll show you how).
- Launch it so people can actually use it.
- Learn how to show it to others and charge for it.

**Very important:**  
No previous coding experience needed. We’ll start from zero.

**Mini example block:**  
**Example: “Homework Reminder App”**  
- Sends you (and maybe your parent) reminders so you never forget assignments  
- You charge other students ₹99/month  
- Boom, your first SaaS

Note for legal clarity on page:  
> We can’t promise you’ll make money. We *can* teach you how to try.

---

### 4.3 "Why This Is Different from a Normal Coding Class"

This is a positioning block. It should visually look like a side-by-side comparison.

**Normal Coding Class**
- Learn syntax
- Watch teacher code
- Do exercises
- Make a calculator app you’ll never use

**This Workshop**
- You build something to solve a real problem in your life/school/home
- You learn product thinking, not just typing code
- You get to launch it, show it, maybe even sell it
- You learn how to talk to people like a founder

Goal: Make kids feel like founders, not “students doing homework.”

Style: simple, almost meme-like, high contrast, easy to screenshot and share.

---

### 4.4 "What You’ll Learn (Skills You Actually Keep)"

Audience: student + parent.

1. **Problem Solving**  
   See something annoying in daily life → design a fix.

2. **Software Building**  
   Basics of how apps/websites/tools are made.

3. **UI & UX Thinking**  
   “Will other people actually like using this?”

4. **Launch Mindset**  
   How to release version 1 instead of waiting for “perfect”.

5. **Talking to Users**  
   Asking “What do you need?” and not getting shy.

6. **Basics of Pricing & Selling Online**  
   Understanding value, not “becoming a businessman overnight.”

**Parent reassurance sentence here:**  
These are the same skills adult startup founders learn. We just teach them in a way that makes sense for 10–14 year olds — with lots of help.

We should visually badge these with simple icons (lightbulb, laptop, chat bubble, rocket, etc.).

---

### 4.5 "Who Can Join?"

**Include clearly, on the page:**
- Students of Next School
- Grade 5 and above
- You don’t need to know how to code yet
- You do need to be curious and willing to build, not just watch

**Session format (to display on page):**
- Weekly in-person small-group sessions at school  
- Runs for a few months, not just 1 weekend  
- By the end, you’ll have something you can show and say “I built this.”

**Operational assumptions to show (these get updated once confirmed with school):**
- Weekly sessions, 1–2 hours each, over a few months.

---

### 4.6 "Who’s Teaching You?"

This is trust + safety.

Short intro in first-person voice:

> Hi, I’m Ulhas Mandrawadkar.  
> I run a software company that builds real products for real clients.  
> I’ve taught adults and fresh graduates how to become software engineers and ship production apps.  
> Now I want to bring that same builder energy to students who are still in school — because I believe you shouldn’t have to wait until you’re 25 to build something real.

Parent note to include under that:

- Sessions are conducted in school, in a structured and safe environment.  
- Focus is on creativity, problem solving, ethical use of technology, and responsible selling.

Also:  
Place a real instructor photo here (not stock). Not in a suit. Open, approachable, safe.

Also include a small line like:  
“Approved by school leadership.”

---

### 4.7 Student Reactions / Social Proof

We should design this block even if we don’t have testimonials yet. We’ll fill it later.

We want two quote styles:

**Student quote style:**  
> “I made an app that tells my dad to stop forgetting pickup time.”  
> – Aarav, Grade 6

**Parent quote style:**  
> “I’ve never seen her this excited about ‘homework.’ She’s treating it like her own startup.”  
> – Parent of Grade 7 student

For first launch, we can label them as “From previous teaching experience / sample format” or “Coming soon from the first batch.”

This block should look friendly and personal, almost like sticky notes or chat bubbles.

---

### 4.8 FAQ (for Parents)

Tone: calm, direct, specific.

**Q1. Will my child be writing code?**  
Yes, but not on day 1. First we decide what we’re building. Then we learn just enough tech to make it work.

**Q2. Is this safe / supervised?**  
Sessions happen on campus, in small groups, guided by an experienced instructor.

**Q3. How much time per week?**  
Around X hours/week in school + some optional work at home if they want to improve their idea.  
(X is expected ~1–2 hrs/week; confirm with school.)

**Q4. Will kids be pushed to “make money”?**  
We teach them how money on the internet works (subscriptions, selling digital tools, etc.) in an age-appropriate and ethical way. There is zero pressure to sell. Learning the process is the goal.

**Q5. Does my child need a laptop?**  
Laptop / device requirements will be shared before the first session (depends on school policy).

**Q6. What if my child is shy or not “technical”?**  
Perfect. This is not only for “top coders.”  
This is for kids who like solving problems, designing, drawing UIs, talking to people, or just making stuff that others use.

**Q7. Is this part of school or an external class?**  
This program is being offered at Next School with approval from school leadership.

**Q8. What happens after the program ends?**  
Your child keeps what they built.  
They’ll know how to keep improving it, and how to launch version 2 on their own.

**Responsible note at the bottom of FAQ:**  
This is not financial advice.  
The real goal is confidence, creativity, and entrepreneurial thinking.

### 4.9 Final CTA Section

This is the closer.

**Kid-facing headline:**  
Ready to build something real?

**Supporting line:**  
Tell us you’re interested. We’ll let you know the start date and batch details.

**Reassurance for parents:**  
No payment now. This is just to help us plan seats and groups.

**Form fields (must be on page):**
- Student’s Name  
- Grade  
- Parent’s Name  
- Parent Email  
- Parent Phone  
- “Why do you want to join?” (short text from the student)

Placeholder text inside that last field:

**Submit button text:**  
“Save My Spot”

**Post-submit inline confirmation message:**  
“Thanks! We’ll reach out with the first session date and details.”

---

## 5. Tone, Voice, and Visual Style

### For the kid-facing parts:
- Energetic, empowering, slightly rebellious in a healthy way.
- Words we WANT: “build,” “launch,” “your app,” “startup,” “real users.”
- Words we AVOID: “curriculum,” “syllabus,” “career pathway,” “ROI,” “monetisation strategy.”

### For the parent-facing parts:
- Calm, transparent, specific.
- Avoid hype.
- Show safety, structure, and intent.

### Visual Style:
- Bright accent colors.
- Handwritten-style arrows, doodles, sticky-note style highlights.
- Screenshots / mockups of dashboards, login screens, timelines, etc. to make it feel real-world.
- Avoid childish cartoon mascots (target age is ~10–14, not 5).

---

## 6. Functional / Technical Requirements

1. **Responsive design**
   - Must work well on mobile.  
   - Parents will likely open via a WhatsApp link on phone.

2. **Lead capture form**
   - Form submission should store entries somewhere we can access (Google Sheet, Airtable, or email notification).
   - After submit, show inline thank-you message (no redirect).

3. **Accessibility**
   - Font size large enough for both kids and parents.
   - Use short paragraphs, bullet lists, clear headings.

4. **Performance**
   - Lightweight, fast load on school WiFi / parents’ 4G.

5. **Branding**
   - Include Next School mention + instructor bio.
   - Placeholder for school logo in hero (top-right).

---

## 7. Metrics / Success Criteria

We consider the landing page successful if:
- We get at least X students to click “Save My Spot” before the first batch (X ~12–15, or whatever the cap is).
- Parents tell us (in WhatsApp follow-up or conversation) that “I understood what this is.”
- Kids can fill the form with:  
  “I want to build ___ app because ___.”  
  → That means the message reached them.

---

## 8. Open Items / Assumptions (to confirm with school)

These are dynamic fields. Page layout must let us edit these easily later:

1. Final eligible grades (currently assuming Grade 5+).
2. Schedule (day of week / time).
3. Duration in months.
4. Class size cap.
5. Laptop / device rules.
6. Whether this is included in school fees or a separate fee.
7. Permission to use the school’s name/logo in hero.

Only this block needs updating once school confirms. Rest of the page can stay stable.
